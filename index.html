					<summary class="FAQques">What is COVID-19?  </summary>
						<div class="ans">	COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. Most people with COVID-19 have 
						mild symptoms, but people can become severely ill. Although most people with COVID-19 get better 
						within weeks of illness, some people experience post-COVID conditions. Post-COVID conditions are 
						a wide range of new, returning, or ongoing health problems people can experience more than four 
						weeks after first being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. Older people and those who have 
						certain underlying medical conditions are more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19. Vaccines 
						against COVID-19 are safe and effective.

			available, use an alcohol-based sanitizer with atleast 60% alcohol.
